üîé Overview

This project simulates a robotic system using *4 DC motors* controlled by an *L293D motor driver, along with a **servo motor* and an *ultrasonic sensor*. The system performs directional movement and reacts to obstacles using real-time distance measurement.

üéØ Objectives

- Control 4 DC motors using L293D to perform:
  - Forward movement for 30 seconds
  - Backward movement for 1 minute
  - Alternating right and left turns for 1 minute
- Stop and change direction when an object is detected within 10 cm using an ultrasonic sensor
- React with a servo motor based on the sensor feedback
  
‚öôÔ∏è Components Used
